CRUD .NET Core Application
Overview
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using .NET Core. It leverages Entity Framework Core for data access and management, providing a robust and efficient way to interact with the database. The application follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and making the codebase easier to manage and extend. This readme provides a brief overview of the application's structure, setup instructions, and key functionalities.

Key Features
The application offers full CRUD functionality for managing entities within a database. Entity Framework Core is utilized to handle all database operations, providing an abstraction over the underlying SQL database and enabling developers to work with data in a more intuitive, object-oriented manner. Controllers are used to manage incoming HTTP requests, interact with the business logic, and return appropriate responses. This setup ensures that the application is both scalable and maintainable.

Getting Started
To get started with the application, clone the repository to your local machine. Ensure you have .NET Core SDK installed, as well as a compatible database server (e.g., SQL Server). Run the provided database migration scripts to set up the initial schema. The application can be run using the dotnet run command from the project directory. Configuration settings such as database connection strings can be found and modified in the appsettings.json file to match your local setup.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with it through a web browser or API client such as Postman. The application exposes a set of RESTful endpoints to perform CRUD operations on the entities. Each controller corresponds to a specific entity and provides endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records. Swagger is integrated into the project, providing a user-friendly interface to explore and test the available endpoints. For additional details on each endpoint and how to use them, refer to the API documentation provided within the application.
